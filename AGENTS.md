# Agent Instructions

- All commit messages must include the full text of the user prompt that triggered the changes.
- Prefer concise Markdown headings and bullet lists when documenting new instructions.
- When editing JavaScript/TypeScript files, follow the existing ESLint/Prettier configuration (run `npm run lint` if unsure).
