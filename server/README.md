# Connect8 Server

This is the backend for Connect8, a real-time, two-player word-guessing game developed almost exclusively by prompting AI tools.

## Setup & Running

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the server:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   - You can specify the port with the `PORT` environment variable or as a command-line argument:
     ```sh
     PORT=4000 npm start
     # or
     npm start 4000
     ```

## Features
- Express + Socket.IO real-time backend
- Room and player management

## Development
